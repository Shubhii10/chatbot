Sparkles has a customer-friendly refund policy designed to ensure satisfaction. Most items can be refunded if they are defective, damaged during transit, or not as described. Refund may be initiated even after the product is delivered. Refund requests must be initiated within 10 days of receiving the item, with some products having specific conditions. Customers can request refunds by contacting Sparkles' customer support, providing order details and, if necessary, images of the item. Refunds are subject to approval and will be processed once the item is received and inspected. Some items, like digital products and personalized items, are non-refundable, and return shipping costs may apply. In addition to refunds, Sparkles may offer replacements or exchanges, and customer support is available for any questions or concerns.
